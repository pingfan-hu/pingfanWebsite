## About

Initial thoughts of detecting bots on surveys using LLM.

## Initial Ideas

-   Attempt to use LLM to distinguish between humans responses and bot responses.
-   This survey can be as generic as possible, for example, the apple conjoint surveys.
-   We perform the survey on human participants and via LLM. Then the results will be embedded by GPT models to generate corresponding digital values.
-   Once we have the embedded models for both human and LLM respondents, we can use them as templates to check for our public survey results such as Mechanical Turk.
