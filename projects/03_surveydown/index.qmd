## Overview

![](technologies.svg){fig-align="center" width="550"}

**surveydown** is a flexible, open-source platform for making programmable, markdown-based surveys with {{< var rlink >}}, {{< var quarto >}}, {{< var shiny >}}, and {{< var postgres >}}.

The {{< var rnolink >}} package deployment site can be accessed [here](https://pkg.surveydown.org/).

Here's how it works:

1. Design your survey as a {{< var quarto >}} document using markdown and R code.
2. Render your survey into a {{< var shiny >}} app that can be hosted online and sent to respondents.
3. Store survey response data in a {{< var postgres >}} database. We recommend {{< var supabase >}} as a free, secure, and easy to use option.

The **surveydown** {{< var rlink >}} package provides functions to bring this all together.

**See [Documentation](https://surveydown.org/documentation) to get started making
your own surveydown survey!**

**See [Templates](https://surveydown.org/templates) for a variety of templates!**

## Motivation

Most survey platforms use graphic interfaces or spreadsheets to define survey content, making version control, collaboration, and reproducibility difficult or impossible. Surveydown was designed to address these problems. As an open-source, markdown-based platform, all survey content is defined using **plain text** (markdown and R code) in two files:

- **survey.qmd**: A {{< var quarto >}} document that contains the survey content (pages, questions, etc).
- **app.R**: An R script defining a shiny app that contains global settings (libraries, database configuration, etc.) and server configuration options (e.g., conditional page skipping / conditional display, etc.).

This approach makes it easy to reproduce, share, and version control your surveys with common tools like Git. And since all survey data is stored in a {{< var postgres >}} database, you have total control over where your survey data lives. We recommend {{< var supabase >}} as a free, secure, and easy to use option.

## Usage

To start using **surveydown**, you need both {{< var rlink >}} and {{< var quarto >}} installed on your computer. We also recommend working with an IDE that has good support for {{< var rnolink >}}, Quarto, and Shiny. {{< var rstudio_ide >}} is great, and we also like {{< var positron >}} and {{< var vscode >}}.

You can install `surveydown` from CRAN in your {{< var rnolink >}} console:

```{r}
#| eval: false

install.packages("surveydown")
```

Or you can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/surveydown-dev/surveydown):

```{r}
#| eval: false

# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak('surveydown-dev/surveydown')
```

Load the package with:

```{r}
#| eval: false

library(surveydown)
```
