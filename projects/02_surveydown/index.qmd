## About

The {surveydown} R package is a flexible, open-source platform for making surveys with [R](https://www.r-project.org), [Quarto](https://quarto.org), [Shiny](https://shiny.posit.co), and [Supabase](https://supabase.com).

This project is led by [Prof John Helveston](https://www.jhelvy.com). For more details, see our [About](https://surveydown.org/about) page.

The basic concept is:

1.  Design your survey as a [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) document using
    markdown and R code.
2.  Convert your survey into a [Shiny](https://shiny.posit.co/) app that
    can be hosted online and sent to respondents.
3.  Store your survey responses in a [Supabase](https://supabase.com/)
    database (or any Postgres database).

The {surveydown} R package provides functions to bring this all
together.

**See the [documentation](https://surveydown.org/documentation) to get started making
your own surveydown survey!**

**See the [demo surveys](https://surveydown.org/demos) and use them as your survey templates!**

## Background & Motivation

Most survey platforms (e.g., Google forms, Qualtrics, etc.) use
drag-and-drop interfaces to design surveys, making version control and
collaboration with others difficult. They’re also not reproducible
(others cannot easily reproduce a survey made on these platforms), and
many require a paid subscription or license to use.

The surveydown package was designed to address these problems. As an
open-source, markdown-based platform, all survey content is defined with
plain text (markdown and R code) in a `survey.qmd` file and an `app.R`
file that renders your survey into a Shiny app that can be hosted
online. This makes your survey easy to reproduce, share, and version
control with common tools like Git. The survey data collected is also
owned by the survey designer in a separate Postgres database (we
recommend Supabase as a free and open-source database provider).

If you’re curious where this whole idea came from, check out this [blog
post](https://www.jhelvy.com/blog/2023-04-06-markdown-surveys/), which
outlines more on the general idea and the motivation for it. The post is
now outdated in terms of the overall package design, but it provides
something of an origin story and some of the motivation for developing
this project.

## Installation

### 1. Install [R](https://CRAN.R-project.org/) & [Quarto](https://quarto.org/)

We also recommend working with an IDE that has good support for R,
Quarto, and Shiny.
[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/categories/rstudio-ide/) is great, and
we also like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) and
[Positron](https://github.com/posit-dev/positron).

### 2. Install the {surveydown} R package

The {surveydown} R package is not yet on CRAN, but you can install the
development version from GitHub with the following command in your R
console:

```{r}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("surveydown-dev/surveydown")
```

### Version Control

We made some functions to make it easier to keep your R package up to
date.

To *check* which version of the {surveydown} package you have installed,
run:

```{r}
surveydown::sd_version()
```

To *update* to the latest version of the {surveydown} package, run:

```{r}
surveydown::sd_update()
```

## Citation Information

If you use this package for in a publication, please cite it! You can
get the citation by typing `citation("surveydown")` into R:

```{r}
