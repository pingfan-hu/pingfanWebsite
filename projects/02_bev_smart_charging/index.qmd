## Abstract

As power systems transition to renewable energy, integrating Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) into grid operations becomes crucial for optimizing resources and integrating renewable energy sources. This study examines two grid-integration strategies: Supplier-Managed Charging (SMC), which gives utilities control over charging timing, and Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G), which transforms BEVs into distributed energy storage resources. Using a discrete choice experiment with 1,356 current BEV owners, we quantify how program attributes influence enrollment decisions. Our multinomial logit models reveal that SMC participants predominantly value operational flexibility and recurring payments, while V2G participants prefer monetary incentives, indicating willingness to provide grid services for compensation. Through simulation analysis, we identify program "attribute equivalencies" that quantify changes needed in attributes to achieve equivalent enrollment levels. These findings offer insights for developing market mechanisms and policy frameworks that accelerate BEV integration into future energy systems while supporting power system decarbonization.

## Keywords

Grid integration, Vehicle-to-grid, Energy storage, Smart charging, Consumer preferences, Discrete choice experiment

## Highlights

- Largest survey to date (N=1,356) of BEV ownersâ€™ stated preferences for grid-integration programs.
- Quantified how smart charging and V2G program attributes influence grid service participation.
- Revealed distinct preference patterns: flexibility drives SMC while compensation drives V2G.
- Developed attribute equivalencies to facilitate grid-integration program design.
