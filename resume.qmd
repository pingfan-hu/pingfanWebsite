# Summary

I am a research software engineer and PhD candidate in [EMSE](https://emse.engineering.gwu.edu/) at [George Washington University](https://www.gwu.edu/), supervised by professor [John Helveston](https://www.jhelvy.com). I do {{< var rlink >}} development and data analysis in human behavior using choice models. I develop websites and webapps using {{< var quarto >}} and {{< var shiny >}}.
