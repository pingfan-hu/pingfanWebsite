Hi! My name is Pingfan Hu. I am a PhD student and researcher at George Washington University in the Department of [Engineering Management and Systems Engineering](https://www.emse.seas.gwu.edu) with expertise in systems engineering and data analysis.

I have 4 years' engineering working experience in top companies, and am now back to school and pursuing a PhD degree to seek for a breakthrough in academia.

My current project is a [conjoint survey](https://jhelvy.github.io/smartcharging/) for BEV (Battery Electric Vehicle) Smart Charging adoption. This project aims to understand BEV owners' preferences with respect to participating in the Smart Charging programs to improve grid resilience and enable greater integration of renewable energy onto the grid.
