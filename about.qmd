My name is **Pingfan Hu**, a PhD student in [EMSE](https://emse.engineering.gwu.edu/) at [George Washington University](https://www.gwu.edu/), supervised by professor [John Helveston](https://www.jhelvy.com). I am experienced in {{< var rlink >}} (base {{< var rnolink >}} + tidyverse) and {{< var python >}} development mainly in data analysis and data viz. I write moderate CSS and HTML codes as well.

I'm currently working on 2 projects in my field of study. The [Smart Charging Adoption](https://sc.pingfanhu.com) project is a survey-based data analysis that studies BEV (Battery Electric Vehicle) owners' willingness to opt in smart charging programs, funded by the {{< var sloan >}}. [surveydown](https://surveydown.org): A flexible, open-source platform for making surveys with {{< var rnolink >}}, Quarto, Shiny, and PostgreSQL, co-author with professor [John Helveston](https://www.jhelvy.com), awarded 2nd prize in the [2024 Student Open Source Awards Program](https://ospo.gwu.edu/2024-student-open-source-award-winners) at GWU.

My current project is a [conjoint survey](https://jhelvy.github.io/smartcharging/) for BEV (Battery Electric Vehicle) Smart Charging adoption. This project aims to understand BEV owners' preferences with respect to participating in the Smart Charging programs to improve grid resilience and enable greater integration of renewable energy onto the grid.
