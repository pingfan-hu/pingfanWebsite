My name is **Pingfan Hu**, a PhD student in [EMSE](https://emse.engineering.gwu.edu/) at [George Washington University](https://www.gwu.edu/), supervised by professor [John Helveston](https://www.jhelvy.com). I am experienced in {{< var rlink >}} (base {{< var rnolink >}} + tidyverse) and {{< var python >}} development mainly in data analysis and data viz. I write moderate CSS and HTML codes as well.

I'm currently working on 2 projects in my field of study. The [Smart Charging Adoption](https://sc.pingfanhu.com) project is a survey-based data analysis that studies BEV (Battery Electric Vehicle) owners' willingness to opt in smart charging programs, funded by the {{< var sloan >}}. The [surveydown](https://surveydown.org) {{< var rnolink >}} package is a flexible, open-source platform for making surveys with {{< var rnolink >}}, Quarto, Shiny, and PostgreSQL. Both projects are co-authored with professor [John Helveston](https://www.jhelvy.com). For more information about my projects, please proceed to the [Projects](/projects.html) page.

I write blogs on this site, mainly for the purpose of encapsulating my thoughts and ideas in the process of my research. I also write tutorials and guides for the tools and packages I use. You can find them in the [Blogs](/blogs.html) page.

The pages of [Papers](/papers.html) and [Talks](https://slides.pingfanhu.com) contain my academic publications and presentations. The publications are in forms of conference papers and journal articles, and the talks are in forms of conference posters and presentations.
