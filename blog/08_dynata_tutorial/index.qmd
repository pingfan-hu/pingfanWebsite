## Motivation

When you have your survey link ready, you might want to cooperate with Dynata to recruit your survey. Dynata has 2 link checkpoints:

1. Validate the **Starting Link**
2. Redirect to the **Ending Link**

The Starting Link ensures that the respondent is legitimate, and the Ending Link redirects them to the correct ending pages that Dynata prepares based on your designed filtering mechanism.

The **Starting Link** is ALREADY there as provided by Dynata. You just need to capture the values and validate it. There is one unique Starting Link for each respondent.

The **Ending Link**, on the other hand, should be generated by you as a redirection link back to Dynata. Usually there should be 3 types of Ending Links: "Complete", "Screenout", and "Quotafull". Each of them has a different `rst` value in the link. We'll talk about them later.

This tutorial is based on my previous experience of cooperating with Dynata, in which case I used [formr](https://formr.org) and defined the related values and mechanisms in the XML files and the survey runs. Our lab has now moved on with [surveydown](https://surveydown.org), which is granted with similar capabilities that handle the starting and completion links as required by Dynata.

## Starting Link (Your Survey Link with Dynata IDs)

### Basic Example

Say you have an original survey link, how about the Google official website: [https://www.google.com](https://www.google.com). Say we have 3 IDs and let's call them `id_a=xxx`, `id_b=xxx`, and `id_c=xxx`. Then let's assign them as parameters in the URL, like this:

[https://www.google.com/?id_a=xxx&id_b=xxx&id_c=xxx](https://www.google.com/?id_a=xxx&id_b=xxx&id_c=xxx)

Let's break down the link:

- `https://www.google.com`
- `/?`
- `id_a=xxx`
- `&`
- `id_b=xxx`
- `&`
- `id_c=xxx`

Actually you can click on this link. You'll see this exact link in your browser's URL part, and it is no different from the original [https://www.google.com](https://www.google.com) link.

### Dynata's Case

::: {.callout-tip}
Your Dynata specialist will assign you 2 values (Come back to this part after you've done reading the rest):

1. A `_k` value. It's usually a 4-digit number. Save it.
2. A **Secure Key**, which is a long string of hex values (0-9 and a-f). This is used to generate the `_s` value with HMAC-SHA256 encryption. The Secure Key is **ONLY** used in the HMAC-SHA256 encryption and nowhere else.
:::

The starting link of Dynata has the same structure. Dynata has these IDs:

- `psid`: Unique ID for each respondent (aka survey participant).
- `_k`: short for **keyID**, unique ID for each client (aka survey creator, in short, you).
- `_s`: short for **Starting Signature**, unique ID for each respondent, HMAC-SHA256 Encrypted. This is a bit complicated. I'll explain it later.

Therefore, as you deploy your survey URLs, your `psid` and `_s` are all unique for each respondent, but `_k` stays the same.

Here is a pseudo-example of a Dynata starting link:

https://www.mysurvey.com/?psid=xxx&_k=xxx&_s=xxx

Let's break down the link:

- `https://www.mysurvey.com`
- `/?`
- `psid=xxx`
- `&`
- `_k=xxx`
- `&`
- `_s=xxx`

### Starting Signature (`_s`)

The `_s` value, aka the starting signature, is the most complicated part of the Dynata starting link, and I chose to explain it separately in this sub-section.

You need these recipes to generate the **Starting Signature** (`_s`):

1. The string AFTER the survey URL and BEFORE the `&_s=xxx` part, aka `/?psid=xxx&_k=xxx`.
2. Your **Secret Key** provided by Dynata, which is a long string of hex values (0-9 and a-f).
3. The HMAC-SHA256 encryption algorithm.

If you wanna test the HMAC-SHA256 encryption, you can use the [HMAC-SHA256 Hash Generator](https://www.devglan.com/online-tools/hmac-sha256-online).

With R, you can use the `digest` package to generate the `_s` value. Here is how:

```{r}
# To generate the Starting Signature (_s)
library(digest)
signature_start_validate <- hmac(
    key       = secret_key, # Your Dynata Secure Key
    object    = text_start, # The /?psid=xxx&_k=xxx part
    algo      = "sha256",   # Don't change
    serialize = FALSE       # Don't change
    )
```

The reason why I call it `signature_start_validate` is because it's a validation process. The starting signature `_s` is already generated by Dynata in the starting link. You need to capture that `_s` from the URL, save it as maybe `signature_start`, and validate with this `signature_start_validate` value, so that you need to check if `signature_start == signature_start_validate`.

::: {.callout-tip}
To make your life easier, `_s`, `signature_start`, and `signature_start_validate` are all the same (if the validation is successful).
:::

If they don't match, this respondent should be filtered out. The whole purpose of the `_s` value is this: to ensure legitimate respondents who really click on the link provided by Dynata.

## Ending Link (Redirected Link to Dynata)

Dynata has a URL structure for the ending link: `https://dkr1.ssisurveys.com/projects/end?rst=1&psid=xxx&_k=xxx&_s=xxx`.

Letâ€™s break down the link:

- `https://dkr1.ssisurveys.com/projects/end` (This is the base URL for Dynata's ending link. Don't change this part.)
- `?rst=1` (This is the indicator of completion, in which `1` means complete, `2` means screenout, and `3` means quotafull.)
- `&`
- `psid=xxx`
- `&`
- `_k=xxx`
- `&`
- `_s=xxx` (This is the ending signature, which is also HMAC-SHA256 encrypted.)

### Ending Signature (`_s`)

::: {.callout-important}
Now the tricky part is `_s`, which still using the same ID name as the **Starting Signature**, but this time it's called the **Ending Signature**. It is different from the Starting Signature, and it is also HMAC-SHA256 encrypted.

There are 3 types of ending scenarios: "Complete", "Screenout", and "Quotafull", each of them has an `_s` value.

Therefore, there are actually **4** possible `_s` values: one Starting Signature and up to three Ending Signatures.
:::

You need these recipes to generate the **Ending Signatures** (`_s`):

1. The scenario of "Complete": `/projects/end?rst=1&psid=xxx&_k=xxx`.
2. The scenario of "Screenout": `/projects/end?rst=2&psid=xxx&_k=xxx`.
3. The scenario of "Quotafull": `/projects/end?rst=3&psid=xxx&_k=xxx`.
4. Again, your **Secret Key** provided by Dynata.
5. The HMAC-SHA256 encryption algorithm.

Again, if you wanna test the HMAC-SHA256 encryption, you can use the [HMAC-SHA256 Hash Generator](https://www.devglan.com/online-tools/hmac-sha256-online).

With R, you can use the `digest` package to generate the `_s` values. Here is how:

```{r}
# To generate the Ending Signature (_s)
library(digest)
signature_end <- hmac(
    key       = secret_key, # Your Dynata Secure Key
    object    = text_end, # The /projects/end?rst=x&psid=xxx&_k=xxx part
    algo      = "sha256",   # Don't change
    serialize = FALSE       # Don't change
    )
```

## What You Should Do

So in the end, what you should do? Here is a walk-through:

### Starting Link Validation

::: {.callout-note}
Again, the **Starting Link** is ALREADY there as provided by Dynata. You just need to capture the values and validate it.
:::

1. Capture the `psid`, `_k`, and `_s` values from your **Starting Link**. They are the PSID, keyID, and Starting Signature, respectively.
2. If the `psid` is empty or there is no `psid`, filter out this respondent.
3. Create a `text_start` variable with the value of `/?psid=xxx&_k=xxx`, where `xxx` are the `psid` and `_k` values you just captured.
4. Create a `secret_key` variable with the value of your Dynata Secure Key.
5. Create a `signature_start_validate` variable with the HMAC-SHA256 encryption. You can just use the R scripts I provided in the [Starting Signature](#starting-signature-_s) section.
6. Valide if `signature_start == signature_start_validate`. If they match, you can proceed with the survey. If not, filter out this respondent.

### Ending Link Redirection

::: {.callout-note}
And again, the **Ending Link**, on the other hand, should be generated by you as a redirection link back to Dynata.
:::

1. Reuse your previously captured `psid` and `_k` values.
2. Create a `text_end_1` variable for "Complete" responses, with the value of `/projects/end?rst=1&psid=xxx&_k=xxx`, where `xxx` are the `psid` and `_k` values.
3. Create a `text_end_2` variable for "Screenout" responses, with the value of `/projects/end?rst=2&psid=xxx&_k=xxx`.
4. Create a `text_end_3` variable for "Quotafull" responses, with the value of `/projects/end?rst=3&psid=xxx&_k=xxx`.
5. Reuse your previously stored `secret_key` variable.
6. Create a `signature_end_1` variable for the "Complete" ending signature (`_s`) with the HMAC-SHA256 encryption of `text_end_1`. You can just use the R scripts I provided in the [Ending Signature](#ending-signature-_s) section.
6. Create a `signature_end_2` variable for the "Screenout" ending signature (`_s`) with the HMAC-SHA256 encryption of `text_end_2`. 
6. Create a `signature_end_3` variable for the "Quotafull" ending signature (`_s`) with the HMAC-SHA256 encryption of `text_end_3`.

Here are the R codes you can use (in {surveydown}, the `sd_redirect()` function is used to generate the redirection links):

### Example R Codes

```{r}
# Server setup
server <- function(input, output, session) {
  ### Start of Dynata setup ###

  # Save your secret key in the .env file
  secret_key <- Sys.getenv("SECRET_KEY")

  # Obtain parameters from the URL
  url_pars <- reactive({sd_get_url_pars()})
  psid <- reactive({url_pars()["psid"]})
  keyid <- reactive({url_pars()["_k"]})
  signature_start <- reactive({url_pars()["_s"]})

  # Starting Link Validation
  is_valid_start <- reactive({
    # Get the current URL path (everything after the domain)
    url_path <- session$clientData$url_pathname
    text_start <- paste0(url_path, "?psid=", psid(), "&_k=", keyid())
    signature_start_validate <- hmac(
      key = secret_key,
      object = text_start,
      algo = "sha256",
      serialize = FALSE
    )
    !is.na(psid()) &&
      psid() != "" &&
      (signature_start() == signature_start_validate)
  })

  # Create ending links
  ending_links <- reactive({
    # Ending texts for "Complete", "Screenout", and "Quotafull"
    text_end_1 <- paste0("/projects/end?rst=1&psid=", psid(), "&_k=", keyid())
    text_end_2 <- paste0("/projects/end?rst=2&psid=", psid(), "&_k=", keyid())
    text_end_3 <- paste0("/projects/end?rst=3&psid=", psid(), "&_k=", keyid())

    # Ending signatures (_s) for "Complete", "Screenout", and "Quotafull"
    signature_end_1 <- hmac(
      key = secret_key,
      object = text_end_1,
      algo = "sha256",
      serialize = FALSE
    )
    signature_end_2 <- hmac(
      key = secret_key,
      object = text_end_2,
      algo = "sha256",
      serialize = FALSE
    )
    signature_end_3 <- hmac(
      key = secret_key,
      object = text_end_3,
      algo = "sha256",
      serialize = FALSE
    )

    # Ending links of "Complete", "Screenout", and "Quotafull"
    list(
      complete = paste0(
        "https://dkr1.ssisurveys.com/projects/end?rst=1&psid=",
        psid(),
        "&_k=",
        keyid(),
        "&_s=",
        signature_end_1
      ),
      screenout = paste0(
        "https://dkr1.ssisurveys.com/projects/end?rst=2&psid=",
        psid(),
        "&_k=",
        keyid(),
        "&_s=",
        signature_end_2
      ),
      quotafull = paste0(
        "https://dkr1.ssisurveys.com/projects/end?rst=3&psid=",
        psid(),
        "&_k=",
        keyid(),
        "&_s=",
        signature_end_3
      )
    )
  })

  ## Redirect buttons
  sd_redirect(
    id = "redirect_complete",
    url = ending_links()$complete,
    button = TRUE,
    label = "Back to panel"
  )

  sd_redirect(
    id = "redirect_screenout",
    url = ending_links()$screenout,
    button = TRUE,
    label = "Back to panel"
  )

  sd_redirect(
    id = "redirect_quotafull",
    url = ending_links()$quotafull,
    button = TRUE,
    label = "Back to panel"
  )

### A Working Template of External Redirect

Start with the [Extrenal Redirect](https://surveydown.org/templates/external_redirect) template. This is a working template without HMAC-SHA256 encryption. It has the basic components of a survey that redirects to an external link. You can modify it to fit your Dynata needs.
