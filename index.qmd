## Welcome to my website!

My name is **Pingfan Hu**, a PhD student in [EMSE](https://emse.engineering.gwu.edu/) at [George Washington University](https://www.gwu.edu/), supervised by professor [John Helveston](https://www.jhelvy.com). I am experienced in R (base R + tidyverse) and Python development mainly in data analysis and data viz. I write moderate CSS and HTML codes as well.

My ongoing projects are:

1. [Smart charging adoption](https://sc.pingfanhu.com): A survey-based data analysis that studies BEV (Battery Electric Vehicle) owners' willingness to opt in smart charging programs.
2. [surveydown](https://surveydown.org): A flexible, open-source platform for making surveys with R, Quarto, Shiny, and Supabase, co-author with professor [John Helveston](https://www.jhelvy.com).
