## Welcome to my website!

I am a research software engineer and PhD candidate in [EMSE](https://emse.engineering.gwu.edu/) at [George Washington University](https://www.gwu.edu/), supervised by professor [John Helveston](https://www.jhelvy.com). I do {{< var rlink >}} development and data analysis in human behavior using choice models. I develop websites and webapps using {{< var quarto >}} and {{< var shiny >}}.

#### Research Focus:

1. **Transportation Research**: I study human behavior in sustainable transportation using discrete choice models. My work focuses on smart charging [adoption](projects/01_sc_adoption) and [economy](projects/02_smc_economy) analysis, providing insights to help policymakers and utilities design better systems that benefit both the grid and EV owners.
2. **Open-Source Software**: I develop open-source tools for survey construction and data analysis. [surveydown](https://surveydown.org) is a flexible platform for creating surveys with {{< var rnolink >}}, Quarto, and Shiny. [sdstudio](https://sdstudio.surveydown.org) is a companion GUI for surveydown.
