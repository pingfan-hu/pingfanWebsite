## Introduction {.smaller}

- **Unmanaged** BEV charging is becoming a problem to the grid.
- **Managed** charging is cheaper and smoothes out the grid load.
- **Smart** charging: Supplier-Managed Charging (SMC) and Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G).

![](figs/smart_charging.png){fig-align="center" width="65%"}

::: {.notes}
Unmanaged BEV charging is becoming a problem to the grid due to the spike. That's why we need managed charging to smoothes out the grid load as well as keep the price low.

Smart charging is a type of managed charging, which includes Supplier-Managed Charging, shortened as SMC, and Vehicle-to-Grid, shortened as V2G.
:::

## SMC - Supplier Managed Charging

- SMC smooths out overnight EV charging demand.
- Electricity demand is controlled below capacity threshold.
- It saves money and reduces pollution.

![](figs/education_1_half.png){fig-align="center"}

::: {.notes}
For SMC, Supplier-Managed Charging, it smooths out the overnight EV charging demand.

As you can see, with unmanaged charging, the BEV load easily passes over the capacity threshold.
:::

## SMC - Supplier Managed Charging

- SMC smooths out overnight EV charging demand.
- Electricity demand is controlled below capacity threshold.
- It saves money and reduces pollution.

![](figs/education_1.png){fig-align="center"}

::: {.notes}
But with SMC, the electricity demand is controlled below the threshold. It reduces the peak demand and saves money.
:::

## V2G - Vehicle-to-Grid

![](figs/education_2.png){fig-align="center" width="70%"}

::: {.notes}
V2G is short for Vehicle-to-Grid. It is another type of smart charging that allows BEV owners to sell electricity back to the grid. With V2G, BEVs become potential sources of electricity.
:::

## [Smart charging depends on enrollment.]{style="text-align: center; display: block;"} {.center}

## Literature Review

1. A study by @wong_incentives_2023 examined **incentives** affect the EV owners' acceptance, <span style="color: #739C69">but EV ownership is only 19%</span>.
2. A study by @philip_consumer_2024 found **range anxiety** matters, <span style="color: #739C69">but EV ownership is only 1.28%</span>.
3. Another study by @huang_are_2021 indicates the importance of **fast charging**, <span style="color: #739C69">but the sample size is only 157</span>.

None of them have demographics data to study <span style="color: #739C69">heterogeneity</span>.

::: {.centered-text .container}
We need high EV ownership & large sample size, and consider heterogeneity.
:::

::: {.notes}
There's been a few studies that looked on people's willingness to participate to smart charging programs, but they all have small sample size and low EV ownership. Therefore, we aimed to conduct a large-scale survey with high EV ownership to study the heterogeneity of BEV owners' preferences.
:::

## Research Questions {style="line-height: 2;"}

1. **Sensitivity**: How do changes in smart charging program **features** influence BEV owners' willingness to opt in?

2. **Enrollment Rate**: Under what **combinations of features** will BEV owners be more willing to opt in to smart charging programs?

<br>

::: {.centered-text .container}
**Conjoint survey** to collect BEV owners' willingness.
:::

::: {.centered-text .container}
**Multinomial logit model** for utility simulations.
:::

::: {.notes}
Here we have 2 research questions. Firstly, we want to know the sensitivity of each smart charging program feature; secondly, we want to know under what conditions will BEV owners be more willing to opt in to the programs.

In order to answer these questions, we designed a conjoint survey to collect BEV owners' willingness to participate. Then we used multinomial logit models to simulate the utility of each program feature.

## Conjoint Question Explained

### A Sample Conjoint Question {style="padding-top: 0.5em; text-align: center; font-size: 36px; color: #739C69;"}

![](figs/conjoint_example.jpg){fig-align="center" width="80%"}

::: {style="margin-left: 3em;"}
1. Provide respondents with different **sets** of attributes.
2. Observe choices across random sets.
3. Estimate **utility** of each attribute.
:::

::: {.notes}
But first, I want to explain what conjoint question is. If I care about apples, I would want to know how people value type vs price vs freshness. In this apple example, you can only choose one set of the attributes, so if you pick one option, you pick all the attributes in it. In short, conjoint is about forcing people to make trade-offs.

Let's move on to the conjoint question for SMC programs. Again SMC is short for Supplier-Managed Charging. These are the 5 attributes of SMC. You can see there are cash, override, and battery thresholds, and they all have reasonable ranges. For example, for enrollment cash we have $50 to $300.

Here is a sample SMC program. You can see the one-time enrollment cash, recurring monthly cash, and how many times per month the charging can be shifted back to normal.

The battery thresholds here are well-designed to provide an immediate visual aid of the minimum battery and guaranteed battery. We also used milage instead of percentage to make it more intuitive. The mileage will be shown according to the real values of each participant.

::: {.notes}
This is the conjoint question design for V2G programs. V2G is short for Vehicle-to-Grid. The attributes are similar to SMC, but with some differences. For example, we have monthly occurrence instead of monthly override.

The battery thresholds are in the same layout, but since V2G drains the battery, the lower bound is how much the battery is drained to, and guaranteed battery is how much it's charged back to.
:::

## Sample SMC Question

![](figs/smc_question.jpg){fig-align="center"}

::: {.notes}
There are 6 SMC conjoint questions. In each question, participants are provided with 2 valid options and a "Not Interested" option. It's important to have this "Not Interested" option, because it is a validation of willingness. When participants choose from these 2 valid options, they are surely to be interested in what they choose. Otherwise, they will choose "Not Interested".

Without compensation, users will not participate.
:::

::: {.notes}
The willingness to participate is quantified with the multinomial logit model, shortened as MNL. The utility of each option is a linear combination of the attributes, which is the $v_j$ here, plus an error term, shown as $\epsilon_j$. The probability of choosing an option is the exponential of its utility divided by the sum of exponentials of all utilities.

Here are the coefficient estimate plots of both programs. As you can see, the "No Choice" has highgest coefficient, which simply means that without compensation, users will not participate in the programs.

However, coefficients alone are not enough to interpret the willingness to participate. A more intuitive approach is the sensitivity, which means by how much the enrollment rate will change when a feature value changes.

1. **Smaller** value indicates higher efficiency.
2. **Monetary** incentives are valued more in V2G than SMC.
3. **Guaranteed** threshold is more important in SMC than V2G, indicating range anxiety.
4. Attribute equivalencies can be used to inform incentive design.
:::

::: {.notes}
Because the sensitivity plots are linear in the areas we concern, there is a convenient way to reveal the relevant importance of each feature. Imagine we want to increase 5% of enrollment for each program. We start from baseline, and increase each feature value individually. Then we can see how much each one needs to be, in order to achieve the 5% enrollment increase. And here are our interpretations:

To start with, smaller value indicates higher efficiency, and recurring incentives are more important thant one-time. For example, in SMC, the enrollment cash needs to be \$64.7 to achieve a 5% enrollment increase, while for monthly cash, it only needs to be \$3.2. So monthly cash is more efficient than enrollment cash. Same is true for the 2 types of cash in V2G.

Also, guaranteed threshold is more important in SMC than in V2G, indicating range anxiety. Finally, monetary incentives are valued more in V2G than in SMC. This indicates that BEV owners are willing to leverage their BEVs as a source of income.
:::

## SMC Scenario Analysis
![](figs/smc_scenario_plot.png){fig-align="center"}

::: {style="font-size: 26px;"}
1. **Flexibility** is highly valued.
2. **Recurring** incentives are more important than one-time.
3. Payment alone is not enough.
:::

::: {.notes}
So, after analysis of all these individual features, we can combine them into programs. We call them "scenarios". I want to emphasize that the purpose of doing these evaluations is to wisely allocate the resources of the grid. Therefore, we need to maximize the enrollment of each program with least efforts.

Here for SMC we have 3 scenarios. They are flexibility, recurring cash, and one-time cash designated.

As we can see, for SMC, flexibility is highly valued, and recurring incentives are more important than one-time. So due to the range anxiety, payment alone is not enough. There should be a combination of flexibility and monetary incentives.
:::

## V2G Scenario Analysis
![](figs/v2g_scenario_plot.png){fig-align="center"}

::: {style="font-size: 26px;"}
1. Still, **recurring** incentives are more important than one-time.
2. But **flexibility** is not as important compared with SMC.
3. Owners are willing to leverage BEV as a source of income.
:::

::: {.notes}
For V2G programs, recurring incentives are also more important than one-time. But flexibility is compromised since owners are willing to use their BEVs as a source of income. So the V2G programs are more incentive powered than SMC programs.

## Smart Charging Enrollment Simulator {style="text-align: center;"}

[![](figs/simulator.png){width="100%" fig-align="center" style="border: 2px solid #5654A2;"}](https://gwuvehicle.shinyapps.io/enrollment_simulator/)

::: {.notes}
Here we've made a smart charging enrollment simulator. We can play around with it and see the anticipated enrollment of each program, with different feature values.

1. More enrollment increase in SMC: Guaranteed threshold from 60% to 100%.
2. More enrollment increase in V2G: Recurring cash from $2 to $20.
:::

## Contributions

<br>

1. First **large N** study of BEV owners' preferences for smart charging programs.
2. Quantified the **sensitivity** of BEV owners' preferences for smart charging features.
3. Introduced the concept of attribute **equivalencies** to inform incentive design.
